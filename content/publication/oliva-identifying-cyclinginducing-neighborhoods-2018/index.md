abstract: Understanding how spatial attributes of cities and neighborhoods induce
  cycling is relevant for urban planning and policy making. In this work, ordered
  logit and latent class models are specified and estimated to analyze how the built
  environment affects bicycle-commuting frequency. Data come from a survey to 1,487
  people in the city of Santiago, Chile, including sociodemographic information, travel
  behavior patterns and place of residence and work. Using geographic information
  systems tools, the built environment was characterized with variables calculated
  for a 500-m-radius buffer around the residential and work locations of each individual.
  Two models are estimated, first an ordered logit model confirms that built environment
  variables effect on cycling is similar to what has been reported in the literature,
  with some new findings such as an increase in cycling when public transport accessibility
  is low and the role of built environment attributes at the destination. Second,
  a latent class ordered logit is used to identify two classes of neighborhood in
  term of their cycling patterns, as a function of their density, presence of cycling
  infrastructure and distance to the main activity center of the city. This result
  allows to map the class membership probabilities, potentially helping to identify
  neighborhoods that encourage cycling and providing relevant information for policy
  making and infrastructure decisions.
