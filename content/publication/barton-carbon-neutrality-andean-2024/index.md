abstract: Purpose This paper aims to analyze the influences of context and methodological
  differences in how universities confront, report and manage carbon neutrality in
  selected Andean universities, contrasted with a university in the USA. Design/methodology/approach
  A sequential, mixed-methods design, using quantitative and qualitative approaches
  was applied. The data analysis is based on a systematic literature review with bibliometric
  analysis to identify how carbon neutrality in universities is understood and applied.
  Informed by the quantitative analysis, the qualitative phase compared the assessment
  methodologies, opportunities and obstacles in three Andean universities – EAFIT
  in Colombia, EPN in Ecuador and the UC in Chile – contrasted with MIT (USA) for
  comparative purposes beyond the region. Findings The bibliometric analysis points
  to the evolution of carbon management and carbon neutrality in universities and
  indicates how universities have applied methodologies and defined opportunities
  and obstacles. In this comparative experience, the contextual issues are brought
  to the fore. The conclusions highlight the importance of context in carbon neutrality
  assessment and argue against crude comparative metrics. While carbon assessment
  protocols provide data on which actions may be taken, the phase of carbon management
  development and the specifics of context – based on local institutional, geographical,
  climatic, cultural, socioeconomic and national policy conditions – are far more
  relevant for identifying actions. Research limitations/implications This study only
  considered four universities, and the findings are not generalizable. The argument
  highlights the point that contextual factors generate important differences that
  may complicate simple comparisons based on the university's type or size. It also
  highlights the differences in the carbon calculation methodologies used by the institutions.
  Practical implications Results build on the recent publications that document the
  Latin American context. The article contributes to knowledge about Andean university
  commitments and actions relating to climate change and carbon neutrality. This knowledge
  can contribute to how universities in the region seek to apply different methodologies,
  set targets and the timing of actions and consider their contextual opportunities
  and obstacles. Originality/value Comparing university carbon footprints and carbon
  neutrality plans is an emerging topic, presenting methodological and institutional
  difficulties. This paper reveals some of these difficulties by comparing parameters,
  actions and implementation processes against contextual factors. While there is
  a drive for international and national comparisons and systematization of data on
  university carbon performance, significant methodological gaps still need to be
  resolved to account for these contextual factors.
