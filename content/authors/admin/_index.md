## About Me

I am an environmental economist inteersted in studying the economics of natural capital. My research ionterest focuses on the spatial effects of climate change on natural capital and biodiversity loss.

My background is in Industrial and Transport engineering, where I researched on built environment and travel behavior. I worked in the wonderful Institute for Sustainable Development at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.
